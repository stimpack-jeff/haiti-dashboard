# Historical Successes: When Haiti Worked (And Why)

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-14 19:40 EST  
**Status:** Preliminary Research - Needs Deeper Archival Work

## Overview
**Research Question:** When did Haiti have functional governance? What enabled it? Why did it end?  
**Why Critical:** Proof-of-concept that Haiti CAN function. Need to understand what changed.

## Identified Periods of Relative Stability

### Period 1: Late 19th Century - Florvil Hyppolite & Tirésias Simon Sam Era (1889-1902)
**Duration:** ~13 years  
**Source:** Wikipedia History of Haiti (Tier 3 - needs verification)

**What We Know (Limited):**
- Described as "rare period of stability"
- Two presidents served sequential terms
- Relative peace compared to surrounding decades (frequent coups 1843-1889, US occupation 1915-1934)

**What We DON'T Know (Knowledge Gap):**
- What governance mechanisms worked?
- Economic conditions during this period?
- Why did stability end after 1902?
- Was this actual state capacity or strongman suppression?

**Status:** 🔴 **INSUFFICIENT DATA** - Need historical archives, economic data, contemporary accounts

---

### Period 2: Pre-2010 Earthquake - Préval/Aristide Partial Stability (2006-2010)
**Duration:** ~4 years  
**Source:** International IDEA Democracy Tracker, Congressional Research Service

**What We Know:**
- "Haiti achieved some stability between 2006 and 2016" (IDEA report)
- Congressional Research: "governance arguably had improved in the years prior to a 2010 earthquake"
- MINUSTAH peacekeeping force present (2004-2017) provided security backdrop
- 2010 earthquake killed 220,000, set development back

**What Worked (Preliminary):**
1. **International peacekeeping presence** (MINUSTAH: 13,000 troops)
2. **Democratic transition** (elections held, transfer of power)
3. **Some institutional rebuilding** (judicial reforms attempted)
4. **Economic growth** (modest, but positive trajectory pre-earthquake)

**Why It Ended:**
- **2010 earthquake** devastated Port-au-Prince
- **Cholera outbreak** (caused by UN peacekeepers) killed 10,000, delegitimized MINUSTAH
- **Political instability** returned (disputed elections 2010-2011)
- **Gang resurgence** as state weakened post-disaster

**Key Insight:** Even this "stable" period required 13,000 international troops. Not self-sustaining.

**Status:** 🟡 **MODERATE DATA** - Recent enough for documentation, but need deeper economic/governance analysis

---

### Period 3: Post-US Occupation Transition (1934-1956)
**Duration:** ~22 years (but with coups and instability)  
**Source:** Historical records (needs verification)

**What We Know:**
- US occupation ended 1934 (occupied 1915-1934)
- Multiple presidents, but no prolonged civil war until Duvalier era (1957+)
- Relative calm compared to 1991 coup, 2004 crisis, current chaos

**What We DON'T Know:**
- State capacity indicators (police strength, tax collection, judicial function)
- Economic conditions
- Whether this was stability or just absence of major conflict

**Status:** 🔴 **INSUFFICIENT DATA** - Historical research needed

---

## What We Can Learn from These Periods

### Common Pattern: External Support + Relative Calm
All identified periods share:
1. **External security presence** (US occupation, MINUSTAH) OR strongman suppression
2. **No major external shocks** (earthquakes, hurricanes during stability)
3. **Limited duration** (longest: 22 years post-US, but unstable; most: 4-13 years)

### Critical Finding: Haiti Has NEVER Had Long-Term Self-Sustaining Stability
- No 30+ year period of functioning democratic governance
- Stability always relied on external force OR authoritarian control
- External shocks (earthquakes, hurricanes, coups) repeatedly derail progress

### Implication for Current Crisis:
**Haiti lacks historical precedent for the kind of stable, democratic state being proposed.**

This doesn't mean it's impossible, but means:
- Can't simply "restore" something that worked before (it never did long-term)
- Must BUILD something new, not rebuild something old
- 20-year commitment is realistic (longer than any historical success period)

## Comparison: Why Did Dominican Republic Succeed While Haiti Failed?

**Same island, radically different outcomes. Why?**

### Factors Favoring DR (Preliminary Hypotheses):

1. **Colonial Legacy:**
   - DR: Spanish colony (integrated into Spanish empire, institutions)
   - Haiti: French slave colony (extractive, no institution-building)

2. **Independence Process:**
   - DR: Peaceful independence from Spain (1821), brief Haiti occupation (1822-1844), then self-rule
   - Haiti: Violent revolution (1791-1804), international isolation, debt to France

3. **Economic Structure:**
   - DR: Diversified (agriculture, tourism, manufacturing, remittances)
   - Haiti: Remittance-dependent, little industry, 98% deforestation

4. **Political Culture:**
   - DR: Authoritarian but stable periods (Trujillo 1930-1961, Balaguer 1966-1978, 1986-1996)
   - Haiti: Coup-rebellion cycles, weak institutions

5. **External Relations:**
   - DR: Better US relations, tourism investment, MLB pipeline (soft power)
   - Haiti: Isolation, negative perceptions, less investment

6. **Geography:**
   - DR: Less deforestation (40% vs. Haiti's 2%), better agricultural potential
   - Haiti: Mountainous western side, more erosion, less arable land

**Status:** 🟡 **MODERATE DATA** - Well-documented differences, but causal mechanisms debated

## Case Study: René Préval Administration (2006-2011)

**Most Recent "Success" Period - Worth Deeper Analysis**

### Context:
- Elected 2006 after Aristide's ouster (2004)
- MINUSTAH peacekeeping force providing security
- Post-conflict reconstruction phase
- Second term for Préval (first term 1996-2001, also relatively stable)

### What Worked:
1. **Political legitimacy** - Democratic election, broad support
2. **International backing** - US, UN, Caribbean support
3. **Economic growth** - 2-3% GDP growth pre-earthquake
4. **Security improvements** - Gang violence declined (but didn't disappear)
5. **Institutional rebuilding** - Police training, judicial reforms (slow progress)

### What Failed:
- **Poverty reduction minimal** - 70-80% still in poverty
- **Corruption persisted** - Elite capture continued
- **Infrastructure weak** - Vulnerable to earthquake
- **Gang dismantling incomplete** - Gangs suppressed, not eliminated
- **Dependence on external support** - MINUSTAH holding security, not Haitian forces

### 2010 Earthquake Impact:
- **220,000 dead**
- **1.5 million displaced**
- **Government buildings destroyed** (including National Palace)
- **Economy devastated** (~120% of GDP in damages)
- **Cholera outbreak** (UN peacekeepers) killed 10,000, delegitimized MINUSTAH

### Why This Period Matters:
**Closest thing to "working" Haiti in recent memory.**  
If we could restore 2006-2010 conditions + prevent earthquake/cholera, that's a realistic benchmark.

But note: Even this required 13,000 international troops and wasn't solving root causes (poverty, elite capture).

## Historical State Capacity Indicators (Need Data)

### Questions for Further Research:

1. **Police-to-Population Ratio:**
   - What was HNP strength in 2006-2010? (Need exact numbers)
   - How does it compare to current ~13,000 officers for 11M people?
   - International standard: ~300 officers per 100k (Haiti needs 33,000)

2. **Tax Collection:**
   - What % of GDP did Haitian government collect in taxes during stable periods?
   - Current: ~10% (very low, even for developing countries)
   - Need historical trend line

3. **Judicial Function:**
   - Conviction rates during stable periods?
   - Case backlog?
   - Currently: ~80% of prisoners in pre-trial detention, massive backlog

4. **Economic Indicators:**
   - GDP growth rates during stable periods (2006-2010: 2-3%)
   - Employment rates (currently: 60%+ unemployment/underemployment)
   - Poverty rates over time (always high, but trends?)

5. **Infrastructure Access:**
   - Electricity coverage during stable periods (currently: <50%)
   - Water access (currently: ~60% improved sources)
   - Roads (most unpaved, deteriorating)

**Status:** 🔴 **DATA GAP** - Need World Bank historical data, IMF reports, UN statistics

## Critical Insight: Haiti Needs to Build, Not Rebuild

### Why "Rebuild" Framing is Wrong:
- Implies there was a functional state to restore
- Historical evidence shows: **Haiti never had prolonged self-sustaining stability**
- Even "good" periods (2006-2010) required external military presence

### Why "Build" Framing is Right:
- Must create something that never existed: **Democratic, self-sustaining, stable Haitian state**
- Can't restore Jean-Jacques Dessalines' Haiti (1804-1806, authoritarian, assassinated)
- Can't restore US occupation stability (1915-1934, colonial, illegitimate)
- Can't restore Préval's Haiti (2006-2010, externally dependent, destroyed by earthquake)

### Implications:
1. **No blueprint from Haiti's past** - Must adapt models from elsewhere (Medellín, Rwanda, Liberia)
2. **Longer timeline** - Building from scratch takes 20-30 years (not 5-10 to "restore")
3. **Higher ambition** - Aiming for something Haiti has never achieved
4. **Need for vision** - Can't just "return to normal" (normal was dysfunctional)

## What Would "Success" Look Like?

### Minimal Success (Stable but Poor):
- Homicide rate <20 per 100k (vs. current ~80)
- Gangs controlled <10% of territory (vs. current 80%)
- Democratic elections held regularly
- GDP growth 2-3%/year
- Police force 25,000+ (professional, non-corrupt)
- 50% reduction in poverty over 20 years

**Historical precedent:** Préval-era Haiti (2006-2010), but self-sustaining

### Moderate Success (Stable and Developing):
- Homicide rate <10 per 100k
- Gangs eliminated or marginalized
- Democratic consolidation (peaceful power transitions)
- GDP growth 4-5%/year
- Middle class expansion (30% of population)
- Infrastructure functional (electricity, water >80% coverage)

**Historical precedent:** None in Haiti. Comparable: Rwanda (authoritarian model), Costa Rica (democratic model)

### High Success (Stable and Prosperous):
- Homicide rate <5 per 100k
- Near-zero gang presence
- Robust democracy (free press, civil liberties)
- GDP growth 5-7%/year
- Middle class majority (>50%)
- Regional integration (tourism, manufacturing, services hub)

**Historical precedent:** None in Haiti. Comparable: Botswana (resource management), Uruguay (democratic stability)

## Next Research Priorities (To Fill Gaps)

1. **Archival research on 1889-1902 period** - What made Hyppolite/Sam era stable?
2. **Detailed Préval administration analysis** - Governance mechanisms 2006-2010
3. **State capacity indicator timeline** - Police, tax, judicial data 1950-present
4. **Comparative DR analysis** - Why same island, different outcomes?
5. **Haitian diaspora oral histories** - What do older generations remember as "working"?

**Estimated Time:** 2-4 weeks of dedicated archival research + expert interviews

---

## Preliminary Conclusions

### What We Learned:
1. **Haiti has no golden age to restore** - Even "stable" periods were brief, externally dependent
2. **2006-2010 is realistic benchmark** - Closest to functional governance, but still required 13k troops
3. **Building > Rebuilding** - Must create new institutions, not restore old ones
4. **External shocks are constant** - Hurricanes, earthquakes every few years, must build resilience

### What We Still Don't Know:
1. **Specific governance mechanisms that worked** in historical stable periods
2. **State capacity indicators** (police strength, tax collection) over time
3. **Why stability always collapsed** - Pattern analysis needed
4. **Dominican Republic divergence** - Causal mechanisms (not just correlations)

### Confidence Level:
- **High (80%):** Haiti lacks long-term historical stability precedent
- **Moderate (60%):** 2006-2010 represents realistic short-term benchmark
- **Low (40%):** Specific reasons for Hyppolite/Sam era stability (need more research)

## Update to Solutions Matrix

**Based on historical research:**

### Revised Success Probability for Phased Approach:
- Phase 1 (Security): 60% → **55%** (Haiti has never sustained security without external force)
- Phase 2 (DDR): 70% → **65%** (no historical precedent for successful reintegration in Haiti)
- Phase 3 (Social Urbanism): 70% → **60%** (never had stable governance long enough for such projects)
- Phase 4 (Sustainability): 60% → **50%** (aiming for something Haiti has never achieved)

**Overall Success:** 50-60% → **40-50%** (accounting for historical pattern of collapse)

**Why Lower?**
- Historical pattern: Even "good" periods collapse within 5-15 years
- No self-sustaining stability ever achieved
- External shocks (earthquakes, hurricanes) repeatedly derail progress
- 20-year commitment faces high probability of disruption

**Why Not Lower Still?**
- Other countries with similar challenges succeeded (Rwanda, Liberia)
- Modern tools/knowledge didn't exist in Haiti's past
- International commitment (if sustained) can overcome historical patterns

---

**Status:** This research reveals that Haiti's challenge is even harder than anticipated. Not restoring a fallen state, but building one that never existed. But history is not destiny. With right approach, Haiti can become the first version of itself that truly works.

**Next Step:** Need 2-4 weeks of archival research to fill knowledge gaps on historical governance mechanisms.
