# Haiti Deep Research Summary - February 15, 2026

**Research Period:** Feb 7-15, 2026  
**Methodology:** Grokipedia model - Active knowledge building through authoritative sources  
**Sources Consulted:** 15+ (UN, ICG, Reuters, ACLED, academic papers)  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH (80-90%) on political developments, MODERATE (60-75%) on gang strategic intentions

---

## Executive Summary

The period Feb 7-15, 2026 marks a critical inflection point for Haiti. The Transitional Presidential Council (CPT) mandate expired Feb 7 with NO succession plan, plunging Haiti into political limbo. Meanwhile, the Viv Ansanm gang coalition has evolved from criminal organization into a proto-political actor seeking amnesty and government influence. This research identifies 5 new critical knowledge gaps and updates understanding of gang strategy, international security force deployment, and TPS legal battles.

**Key Insight:** Haiti is experiencing simultaneous state collapse and criminal state-building. Gangs aren't just filling a power vacuum—they're actively constructing parallel governance structures with populist legitimacy strategies.

## 1. February 7-15 Political Developments

### CPT Mandate Expiration (Feb 7, 2026)

**What Happened:**
- Transitional Presidential Council (CPT) mandate ended Feb 7, 2026 as planned
- **NO succession structure agreed upon** - Haiti now in constitutional limbo
- Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aimé remains in office with US backing
- CPT attempted to oust Fils-Aimé in late January - US blocked it with sanctions

**US Intervention:**
- **5 CPT members sanctioned** by US (visa restrictions, asset freezes)
- Secretary of State Marco Rubio explicitly ordered CPT dissolved by Feb 7
- **3 US warships** arrived in Port-au-Prince Bay on Feb 5 (show of force)
- US Embassy statement: "We support Prime Minister Fils-Aimé's leadership"

**Current Power Structure (Post-Feb 7):**
- **De facto:** PM Fils-Aimé governs without presidential council
- **De jure:** Constitutional vacuum - no elected president since 2021 assassination
- **Legitimacy:** Entirely dependent on US/international backing
- **Elections:** Provisional Electoral Council declared elections "impossible" before Feb 7 deadline

**Sources:** Reuters (Feb 7), US Embassy Port-au-Prince (Feb 5), Haiti Times (Nov 2025)

**Why This Matters:**
- **Power vacuum invites gang influence** - ICG warns gangs seek to "place allies in administration"
- **Fils-Aimé has no popular mandate** - survives purely on US support
- **No electoral path forward** - 80% of Port-au-Prince under gang control makes voting logistics impossible
- **Precedent for authoritarianism** - US backing unelected PM against transitional council sets dangerous pattern

---

## 2. Viv Ansanm Gang Coalition: Strategic Evolution

### From Criminal Network to Political Actor

**New Intelligence (ICG Report, Dec 2025):**

**Viv Ansanm's Political Strategy:**
1. **Populist messaging** - Self-portrayal as "defenders of the poor against corrupt oligarchs"
2. **Historical symbolism** - Invoking Haiti's revolutionary heritage (Dessalines, anti-colonial resistance)
3. **Social media presence** - Jimmy "Barbecue" Chérizier (FBI fugitive) leads public-facing campaign
4. **Community services** - Installing electricity, distributing school supplies, money handouts in controlled territories
5. **Seeking amnesty** - Primary goal is legal immunity for gang leaders and political allies

**Political Objectives (Explicit):**
- **Dialogue with government** - Wrote to UN Special Representative in August requesting negotiations
- **Placement of allies in government** - Seek to install sympathetic figures in next administration
- **Wide-ranging amnesty** - For gang members AND "economic elites" linked to gangs
- **Political recognition** - Want to field candidates in elections (despite lacking legal party status)

**Guy Philippe Connection:**
- Former rebel and convicted drug trafficker **Guy Philippe** openly supports gang amnesty
- Philippe has political following in Haiti (nationalist, anti-US rhetoric)
- Gang-Philippe alliance could legitimize criminal actors in formal politics

**ACLED Gang Violence Data (Feb 2024-Present):**
- **78% reduction in gang-vs-gang clashes** since Viv Ansanm Feb 29, 2024 coordinated attacks
- **Violence redirected:** From infighting → targeting state institutions
- **Territorial expansion:** Gang activity spread to 100 neighborhoods in Port-au-Prince (up 20%)
- **48 attacks on police stations/government buildings** (Mar-Aug 2024) vs. 16 in prior 6 months

**Strategic Implications:**
- Viv Ansanm truce allows **resource concentration on extortion revenue** ($60-75M annually)
- Reduced infighting = **more efficient criminal operations**
- Gang consolidation makes them **harder to divide and defeat**
- **BUT:** Alliance fragile - depends on shared threat from international forces

**Sources:** ICG Report #110 (Dec 17, 2025), ACLED Special Report (2025), Haiti Times (Dec 15, 2025)

## 3. TPS (Temporary Protected Status) Legal Battle

### Trump Administration vs. 350,000+ Haitian TPS Holders

**Timeline:**
- **Nov 28, 2025:** Trump administration announces TPS termination for Haiti
- **Feb 3, 2026:** Original termination date
- **Feb 2, 2026:** Federal judge (Ana Reyes, D.C. District Court) issues stay - **indefinitely postpones termination**
- **Current status:** TPS protections remain IN EFFECT pending litigation

**Legal Context:**
- Biden administration extended Haiti TPS through Feb 3, 2026 (18-month max extension)
- Trump admin cited "improved conditions" in Haiti (contradicts all evidence)
- Lawsuit: Fritz Emmanuel Lesly Miot, et al. v. Donald J. Trump, et al. (Case No. 25-cv-02471)
- Trump admin appealing to Supreme Court

**Human Impact:**
- **350,000+ Haitian nationals** in US at risk of deportation
- Many work in healthcare, elder care, essential services
- Deportations to gang-controlled Haiti = potential death sentences

**Political Significance:**
- **US policy incoherence:** Deploy warships to "support Haiti's stability" while threatening mass deportations
- **Diaspora leverage point:** 350K Haitians + families = significant political bloc
- **Remittances at risk:** Diaspora sends billions annually to Haiti - deportations could collapse Haitian economy further

**Sources:** Reuters (Feb 3, 2026), USCIS (Feb 4, 2026), Federal Register (Nov 28, 2025)

## 4. International Security Force: MSS → GSF Transition

### Kenyan-Led Mission Severely Understrength

**Current Deployment (Feb 2026):**
- **Actual force strength:** <1,000 personnel (mostly Kenyan police)
- **Authorized strength:** 5,500 (UN Security Council)
- **Target date for full deployment:** Summer 2026 (UN estimate)
- **Reality check:** Deployments 18+ months behind schedule

**Mission Transition:**
- **MSS (Multinational Security Support):** Kenya-led, authorized Oct 2, 2023
- **GSF (Gang Suppression Force):** UN-backed successor, mandate renewed Oct 2, 2025
- **Funding crisis:** Chronic underfunding delays troop contributions

**Operational Results (Limited):**
- **Roads reopened:** Parts of Port-au-Prince and Artibonite temporarily secured
- **State presence restored:** Around Champ de Mars (government district) in Port-au-Prince
- **BUT:** Gains described as "fragile" and "risk reversal without sustained pressure" (UN)
- **Murder rate UP 20%** in 2025 vs. 2024 despite international presence

**Gang Response:**
- Viv Ansanm maintains unity specifically to counter international force threat
- Gangs **intensified attacks on MSS/GSF infrastructure** (May 2024 spike - destroyed facilities earmarked for security forces)
- **No significant territorial losses** by gangs since MSS deployment

**UN Assessment (Jan 2026):**
- "Critical phase" in Haiti crisis
- Security gains "fragile" and inadequate without long-term commitment
- **6.4 million people** require humanitarian assistance (out of 11M population)
- Haiti among "least-funded humanitarian responses globally"

**Sources:** UN News (Jan 2026), Reuters (Feb 7, 2026), New Humanitarian (Dec 2025)

## 5. Gang Violence & Humanitarian Crisis Update

### Violence Expanding Geographically Despite International Force

**2025-2026 Violence Trends:**
- **Murder rate: +20%** (2025 vs. 2024)
- **Kidnappings:** Daily occurrences, no significant reduction
- **Internally displaced:** 1.4 million people by Oct 2025 (up from 400K when CPT formed in April 2024)
- **Food insecurity:** 5 million Haitians (45% of population)

**Geographic Expansion:**
- **Artibonite region (agricultural heartland):** Gran Grif gang killed 115 people in Pont Sondé massacre (Oct 3, 2025) - deadliest single event since 2018
- **Maritime routes:** Gangs controlling coastal waters, attacking cargo vessels
- **Northern border (Dominican Republic):** 400 Mawozo gang controls customs office, police stations
- **Southern Haiti:** Previously peaceful areas now seeing gang incursions

**Revenue Diversification:**
- **Agricultural extortion:** Gangs targeting farms in Artibonite (threatens national food security)
- **Road tolls:** All routes into Port-au-Prince controlled by gangs
- **Container extortion:** $2,000/container from Dominican Republic = $72M/year
- **Maritime extortion:** Targeting boats, cargo vessels

**Humanitarian Context:**
- **580,000+ displaced people** (Aug 2025 estimate)
- **Women/girls at extreme SGBV risk** in displacement camps
- **Cholera risk:** Overcrowded unsanitary conditions in gang-controlled areas
- **Health system collapsed:** Most hospitals in Port-au-Prince closed or inaccessible

**Sources:** UN News (Jan 2026), ACLED (2025), OCHA (Aug 2025), Global R2P (Dec 2025)

## 6. Five NEW Critical Knowledge Gaps Identified

### Gap #1: Gang Political Alliances - WHO Specifically?

**What We Don't Know:**
- Which "politically-connected economic elites" support gangs? (Names, companies, banks)
- What is Guy Philippe's exact relationship with Viv Ansanm leaders?
- Are there CPT members secretly negotiating with gangs?
- Which political parties have gang ties? Evidence?
- Are gangs funding specific candidates for future elections?

**Why Critical:**
- Can't disrupt gang-elite nexus without knowing WHO
- Political capture could legitimize criminal governance
- Sanctions/prosecutions require specific targets

**Research Needed:**
- Investigative journalism on elite-gang financial flows
- Corporate ownership records for front companies
- Phone records, surveillance of suspected elite-gang meetings
- Follow the money: Which banks handle gang money laundering?

---

### Gap #2: Fils-Aimé Government Capacity & Legitimacy

**What We Don't Know:**
- Does PM Fils-Aimé have ANY popular support in Haiti? Polling data?
- What is his actual governance capacity without CPT?
- Is he negotiating with gangs? Evidence?
- What is his relationship with Haitian National Police leadership?
- Can he credibly organize elections? Or just a US puppet?

**Why Critical:**
- Current government is foundation for any intervention strategy
- If Fils-Aimé lacks legitimacy, international support props up failed leader
- Need to know if he's part of solution or obstacle

**Research Needed:**
- Haitian public opinion polling (if feasible in gang-controlled areas)
- Analysis of Fils-Aimé's cabinet composition (technocrats? Cronies? Gang-linked?)
- Budget execution rates - is government functional at all?
- Diplomatic cables or leaked documents on US-Fils-Aimé coordination

---

### Gap #3: MSS/GSF Rules of Engagement & Effectiveness

**What We Don't Know:**
- What are Kenyan forces' ACTUAL rules of engagement?
- Have they conducted offensive operations against gangs? Success rate?
- Casualties: Kenyan forces vs. gang members vs. civilians?
- Are they conducting night raids? Cordons and searches? Or just patrols?
- Why have gangs not lost significant territory despite 1,000 armed international troops?
- What's preventing full 5,500 troop deployment? Money? Political will? Kenyan domestic opposition?

**Why Critical:**
- If MSS/GSF ineffective, scaling up to 5,500 troops won't help
- Need to understand operational constraints to design better interventions
- Civilian casualties from security operations could fuel gang recruitment

**Research Needed:**
- Kenyan press reports on MSS casualties, operational tempo
- UN internal assessments of MSS effectiveness (likely classified - need leaks)
- Interviews with Haitian civilians in areas where MSS operates
- Comparison to MINUSTAH operations (2004-2017) - are same mistakes being repeated?

---

### Gap #4: Viv Ansanm Internal Dynamics & Fracture Points

**What We Don't Know:**
- How is Viv Ansanm revenue shared among member gangs? Disputes?
- Jimmy "Barbecue" Chérizier's actual authority - is he leader or spokesperson?
- Which gang leaders are most pragmatic/open to negotiation vs. hardliners?
- What specific provocations could fracture the alliance?
- Are there rival gang factions NOT in Viv Ansanm? Could they be leveraged?
- How do gang members feel about political strategy vs. purely criminal operations?

**Why Critical:**
- **Divide and conquer** requires knowing where the cracks are
- Targeted strikes on specific leaders could fracture alliance (or strengthen it - need to know)
- Negotiation strategy depends on understanding internal power dynamics

**Research Needed:**
- Gang defector interviews (if any exist outside Haiti)
- Social media analysis of gang communications
- Intelligence gathering on gang leadership meetings, disputes
- Economic analysis: Are some gangs more profitable than others in Viv Ansanm?

---

### Gap #5: Dominican Republic Cooperation & Interests

**What We Don't Know:**
- Is DR government TRULY committed to stopping arms/drug flows? Or complicit?
- Do DR businesses profit from Haiti instability? (Monopolizing trade, cheap labor)
- What is DR public opinion on Haiti crisis? Xenophobia toward Haitian migrants?
- Could DR be persuaded to militarily intervene? Under what conditions?
- Are DR elites linked to Haitian gang money laundering?
- How much leverage does US have over DR on Haiti policy?

**Why Critical:**
- **DR is Haiti's lifeline** - controls main trade routes
- **Container extortion ($72M/year)** happens at DR border - DR could stop it
- **Arms trafficking** flows through DR - border enforcement critical
- Can't solve Haiti without DR cooperation (or at least non-interference)

**Research Needed:**
- DR Ministry of Defense assessments of border security
- Trade data: DR-Haiti cross-border flows (legal + estimated illegal)
- DR political analysis: Would President Luis Abinader support intervention?
- Investigative journalism on DR-Haiti criminal networks
- Historical analysis: When has DR intervened in Haiti? (1937 massacre, occupation periods)

## 7. Updated Solutions Matrix Insights

### What Works (Evidence-Based):

**1. Social Urbanism (Medellín Model) - 🟢 STRONG EVIDENCE**
- **Result:** 90% homicide reduction over 25 years (381/100k → 20/100k)
- **Method:** Cable cars connecting poor hillside neighborhoods, libraries, parks, schools + security operations
- **Prerequisites:** Security baseline FIRST (gangs defeated/weakened), then 15-20 year sustained political commitment
- **Cost:** Billions over decades
- **Applicability to Haiti:** Excellent LONG-TERM model, but REQUIRES security phase completion first

**2. DDR (Liberia Model) - 🟢 STRONG EVIDENCE**
- **Result:** Disarmed 100,000+ former fighters (2003-2004), Liberia stable since
- **Prerequisites:** 
  - **War already ended** (ceasefire in place)
  - **UNMIL 15,000 UN troops** providing security guarantees
  - **Financial incentives** ($300/weapon)
  - **Reintegration programs** (vocational training, psychosocial support)
- **Applicability to Haiti:** ONLY works AFTER gangs militarily defeated - not while they're winning
- **Critical finding:** Reintegration is "Achilles Heel" of DDR - only minority sustainably reintegrated

**3. Mass Incarceration (El Salvador Model) - 🟡 MIXED EVIDENCE**
- **Result:** 80% homicide reduction in 3 years (short-term effective)
- **Costs:** 
  - ~50% wrongful detention rate (8,000+ innocent people imprisoned per Bukele admission)
  - 261 prison deaths in 2024 (torture, abuse)
  - Democratic backsliding (rule of law ranking fell to 111/142)
- **Prerequisites Haiti LACKS:**
  - Prison capacity (Haiti's prisons already gang-controlled)
  - Functional police force (Haiti has ~1,000 police for Port-au-Prince vs. 80,000+ gang members/sympathizers)
  - Authoritarian executive (Haiti has weak transitional government)
- **Verdict:** Could work in Haiti ONLY if preceded by prison-building + security sector reform + authoritarian leader (not currently available)

### What Doesn't Work (Evidence-Based):

**1. International Peacekeeping Without Political Reform (MINUSTAH Model) - 🔴 FAILED**
- 13 years (2004-2017), $7+ billion, gangs returned within 5 years of withdrawal
- Lesson: Security gains without addressing elite-gang nexus = temporary suppression, not resolution

**2. Gang Negotiation Without Security Pressure (El Salvador 2012 Truce) - 🔴 FAILED**
- Homicide reduction reversed when gangs reneged
- Gangs used truce to rearm and reorganize

## 8. Actionable Insights for Policy/StimPack Work

### Insight #1: Political Transition is THE Critical Moment (NOW)

**Why:** Feb 7 CPT expiration creates either:
- **Scenario A:** Vacuum that gangs fill with political allies → criminal state
- **Scenario B:** Strong transitional government backed by international force → window for intervention

**Action:** US/international community must decide WHO governs Haiti post-CPT
- **Option 1:** Back Fils-Aimé (current choice) - risks illegitimacy
- **Option 2:** Convene NEW transitional body with broader representation
- **Option 3:** International trustee

ship (UN administration - precedent: Kosovo, East Timor)

**StimPack Angle:** Could technocratic governance model be proposed? International advisors embedded in Haitian ministries?

---

### Insight #2: Viv Ansanm Amnesty Negotiations Are Coming - Prepare Strategy

**Why:** ICG and gang statements indicate negotiations likely in 2026
- Gangs seeking amnesty + political recognition
- Guy Philippe (drug convict, rebel) positioning as mediator
- Weak government may cave to gang demands

**Action:** Develop **conditional amnesty framework** before gangs dictate terms
- **No blanket amnesty** (legitimizes violence as political strategy)
- **Possible:** DDR-style disarmament → reduced sentences for foot soldiers (NOT leaders)
- **War crimes prosecution** for massacre leaders (Gran Grif Pont Sondé - 115 killed)
- **Asset forfeiture** for gang leaders (seize extortion revenue)

**StimPack Angle:** Could economic reintegration programs for ex-gang members be designed now? Lessons from Liberia DDR?

---

### Insight #3: Elite-Gang Nexus is THE Leverage Point

**Why:** Jamaica's failure shows security alone doesn't work if elites keep funding gangs
- Current sanctions on 5 CPT members = START, not finish
- Need comprehensive elite network disruption

**Action:**
- **Expand sanctions** to Haitian oligarchs, companies, banks handling gang money
- **Asset seizures** in US, Canada, Europe (where elites bank)
- **Prosecutions** under US law (RICO, money laundering - extraterritorial jurisdiction)
- **Corporate accountability** for companies paying gang extortion (complicity in racketeering?)

**StimPack Angle:** Could database of elite-gang financial ties be built? OSINT + investigative journalism partnerships?

---

### Insight #4: Dominican Republic is Underutilized

**Why:** DR controls Haiti's economic lifelines but not fully leveraged
- $72M/year in container extortion crosses DR-Haiti border
- Arms trafficking routes through DR

**Action:**
- **DR border enforcement** - Deploy DR military to stop container extortion
- **Joint DR-Haiti customs operation** under international supervision
- **Economic incentives for DR cooperation** (US aid, trade deals)
- **DR public opinion campaign** - Frame Haiti instability as DR security threat

**StimPack Angle:** Could DR-Haiti integrated border security program be designed? Modeled on US-Mexico cooperation (when it works)?

---

### Insight #5: 20-Year Timeline is Non-Negotiable (Set Expectations Now)

**Why:** 
- Medellín took 25 years
- Liberia took 15+ years for post-conflict stability
- Haiti has NEVER had long-term self-sustaining democratic stability
- Any shorter timeline is fantasy

**Action:**
- **Set realistic expectations** with donors, policymakers
- **Secure long-term funding commitments** (not year-by-year appropriations)
- **Design phased strategy** with clear metrics for each phase:
  - **Phase 1 (Years 1-3):** Security - Defeat Viv Ansanm militarily
  - **Phase 2 (Years 3-5):** DDR - Disarm gang members, rebuild police
  - **Phase 3 (Years 5-15):** Social Urbanism - Infrastructure, jobs, services
  - **Phase 4 (Years 15-20):** Transition to Haitian-led governance

**StimPack Angle:** Could **Haiti Marshall Plan** narrative be developed? Frame as generational investment, not one-time intervention?

---

## 10. What We Now Know (vs. Feb 14)

**Major Knowledge Advances:**

1. ✅ **CPT expiration mechanism** - Understand US role in backing Fils-Aimé, sanctions on CPT members
2. ✅ **Viv Ansanm political strategy** - Not just criminals, but proto-political movement seeking amnesty
3. ✅ **Gang violence trends** - 78% reduction in gang-vs-gang fighting, but violence redirected to state targets
4. ✅ **TPS legal status** - Federal court stay means protections remain (for now)
5. ✅ **MSS/GSF deployment reality** - Severely understrength (<1,000 vs. 5,500 authorized), limited effectiveness

**Knowledge Gaps Closed:** 2 of 5 new gaps (partial)
- Gap #1 (Gang political alliances) - Know Guy Philippe involved, but not full network
- Gap #5 (DR cooperation) - Know container extortion route, but not DR government position

**Knowledge Gaps Remaining:** 8 of original 10 + 3 of new 5 = 11 total critical gaps

---

## 11. Recommendations for Next Research Cycle

### High Priority (1-2 Weeks):

1. **Fils-Aimé government analysis** - Cabinet composition, budget execution, legitimacy polling (if available)
2. **Guy Philippe network mapping** - Who supports him? Financial backers? Gang leader contacts?
3. **DR border security assessment** - Interview DR officials, analyze DR-Haiti trade data

### Medium Priority (2-4 Weeks):

4. **MSS/GSF operational effectiveness** - Kenyan press reports, UN internal assessments (if accessible)
5. **Elite-gang financial networks** - Corporate ownership records, Panama Papers-style investigation
6. **Viv Ansanm internal dynamics** - Gang defector interviews, social media analysis

### Lower Priority (1-2 Months):

7. **Historical DDR comparison** - Liberia, Sierra Leone, Colombia paramilitary demobilization
8. **Medellín social urbanism costs** - Budget data for cable cars, libraries, parks (model for Haiti)
9. **El Salvador prison system** - How did they build capacity for 84,000 detainees in 3 years?
