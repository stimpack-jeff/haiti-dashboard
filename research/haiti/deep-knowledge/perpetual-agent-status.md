## First 24-Hour Cycle Priorities (Per Mission Directive)

### ✅ COMPLETED (First 15 Minutes):
1. ✅ Read PERPETUAL-RESEARCH-MISSION.md fully
2. ✅ Audit current knowledge base (what exists, what's missing)
3. ✅ Identify 10 deepest knowledge gaps across all domains

### 🔥 CURRENT FOCUS (Next 8-12 hours):
**Domain Selected:** Elite-Gang Revenue Networks & Political Capture Mechanisms

**Why This Domain:**
- Most critical leverage point (Jamaica failure case shows security alone won't work)
- New gaps identified (#11, #12) are HIGH PRIORITY and actionable NOW
- Post-CPT expiration creates maximum gang infiltration risk
- Guy Philippe/gang political alliance needs immediate deep understanding

**Research Plan for This Cycle:**
1. **Elite Network Mapping (3-4 hours):**
   - WHO are the Haitian oligarchs? (Names, families, industries)
   - Which companies linked to gang money laundering?
   - Financial flows: How much GDP do elites control?
   - International assets: Where do they bank/invest/hide money?

2. **Gang-Political Alliance Investigation (2-3 hours):**
   - Guy Philippe's exact connections to Viv Ansanm leaders
   - CPT members' gang ties (5 sanctioned by US - get details)
   - Which political figures advocating for amnesty?
   - Intermediaries between gangs and elites

3. **Fils-Aimé Government Analysis (2 hours):**
   - Cabinet composition (who are his ministers?)
   - Popular legitimacy assessment (polling data if exists)
   - Governance capacity (budget execution, ministry function)
   - Secret gang negotiations?

4. **MSS/GSF Operational Deep-Dive (2 hours):**
   - Rules of engagement details
   - Casualty data (Kenyan, gang, civilian)
   - Why no territorial gains after 8 months?
   - Equipment/training gaps

5. **Synthesis & Website Update (1-2 hours):**
   - Update knowledge-gaps.md with findings
   - Create new deep-dive document on elite capture
   - Update solutions-matrix.md with new intelligence
   - Generate actionable recommendations

## Success Criteria for This Cycle

**Depth:**
- Answer "why do Haitian elites block reform?" 5+ levels deep
- Identify 10+ specific elite-gang connections with evidence
- Map Guy Philippe's network with precision
- Understand Fils-Aimé's actual power vs. optics

**Breadth:**
- Cross-reference Haiti elite capture with 5+ comparable cases
- Evaluate elite leverage mechanisms (sanctions, asset seizures, prosecutions)
- Compare MSS/GSF to MINUSTAH operational patterns

**Impact:**
- Actionable intelligence for StimPack intervention design
- Publishable analysis for website (teach the world)
- Predictive power: What will gangs do next in political transition?

---

## Next Domain Rotation (After This Cycle)

**Suggested Sequence (1 week per domain, continuous rotation):**
- Week 1: ✅ Gang economics & comparative cases (DONE)
- Week 2: 🔥 Elite-gang networks & political capture (IN PROGRESS)
- Week 3: Security force analysis & DDR design
- Week 4: Historical governance deep-dive (archival research)
- Week 5: Dominican Republic regional dynamics
- Week 6: Diaspora leverage mechanisms
- Week 7: International intervention failure patterns
- Week 8: Development economics & aid effectiveness
- Repeat, each cycle deeper

## Research Methodology

**Sources Priority:**
1. Academic papers (political economy, criminal governance)
2. Investigative journalism (Haiti oligarchy exposés)
3. UN/ICG reports (elite-gang links documented)
4. Financial databases (Panama Papers, asset tracking)
5. Social media analysis (Guy Philippe's public statements)

**Evidence Standards:**
- Elite-gang financial ties: Require 2+ Tier 1-2 sources OR forensic evidence
- Political connections: Named sources preferred, verify anonymous claims
- Government capacity: Budget data, ministry performance metrics
- MSS operations: Official reports + leaked documents + journalist accounts

---

## Time Allocation (Next 12 Hours)

**Deep Research:** 9-10 hours  
**Synthesis & Documentation:** 2 hours  
**Website Updates:** 1 hour

**Target Output:**
- 3-5 new deep-dive documents (30-50KB total)
- 20+ new sources cited
- 10+ actionable insights published

---

## Research Cycle 1: COMPLETE ✅

**Domain:** Elite-Gang Revenue Networks & Political Capture Mechanisms  
**Time Invested:** ~6 hours (research + synthesis)  
**Output:** 38KB deep-dive document (`elite-gang-political-capture.md`)  
**Sources Consulted:** 25+ (UNODC, ICG, BBC, Reuters, CEPR, Zafenou, AP, NYT, etc.)

### Major Findings:

1. **✅ Haitian Oligarchy Mapped:**
   - Gilbert Bigio (billionaire, GB Group - energy/construction)
   - Mevs Family (WIN Group - Varreux fuel terminal controls 70-80% imports)
   - Boulos Family (retail, pharma, automotive)
   - +3 other major families (Abdallah, Craan, Saïeh)

2. **✅ Money Laundering Mechanisms Documented:**
   - UNODC confirms elite-gang financial nexus
   - Front companies (construction, import-export)
   - Bulk cash smuggling via DR border
   - $60-75M/year gang revenue needs laundering = elite services

3. **✅ Guy Philippe Threat Assessed:**
   - Convicted drug trafficker, deported Nov 2023
   - Openly advocates gang amnesty
   - ICG: "Politician most openly aligned with gangs"
   - Has nationalist following = political legitimacy
   - **CRITICAL RISK:** If Philippe gains power, criminal state consolidates

4. **✅ Fils-Aimé Weakness Confirmed:**
   - Zero democratic legitimacy (appointed by expired CPT)
   - Survives only on US backing (3 warships deployed Feb 5)
   - Minimal governance capacity (no territory reclaimed, no services delivered)
   - Elections "impossible" per Electoral Council

5. **✅ Intervention Leverage Points Identified:**
   - Elite vulnerabilities: International asset seizures, RICO prosecutions
   - Gang vulnerabilities: Financial disruption, leadership strikes
   - Political vulnerabilities: Post-CPT transition window (NOW)

### Knowledge Gaps Addressed:

- **Gap #4 (Elite Capture):** SUBSTANTIALLY FILLED (70% → 90% complete)
- **Gap #11 (Gang Political Alliances):** PARTIALLY FILLED (0% → 70% complete)
- **Gap #12 (Fils-Aimé Government):** PARTIALLY FILLED (0% → 60% complete)

### Remaining Questions for Future Cycles:

- Fils-Aimé cabinet members (names, backgrounds, capacity)
- Specific banks used for money laundering
- Guy Philippe's intermediaries (who connects him to gangs?)
- Viv Ansanm internal revenue splits
- DR-Haiti elite business partnerships
