# Epistemic Foundations: How We Know What We Know About Haiti

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-14 19:30 EST  
**Purpose:** Document source quality, evidence standards, and knowledge confidence levels

---

## Source Quality Hierarchy

### Tier 1: Highest Trust (Base Claims On)
**Characteristics:** Peer-reviewed, multiple independent verification, transparent methodology, data publicly available

**Sources:**
- **UN Official Reports:**
  - UNODC (UN Office on Drugs and Crime) - Quarterly firearms/financial flows reports
  - BINUH (UN Integrated Office in Haiti) - Human rights quarterly reports
  - UN Human Rights Office - Violence/displacement statistics
  - *Why trust:* UN has verification mechanisms, on-ground presence, multiple agencies cross-check
  - *Limitations:* Can be conservative (undercount), political pressure may soften language

- **International Crisis Group (ICG):**
  - "Undoing Haiti's Deadly Gang Alliance" (Dec 2025) - 300+ interviews
  - *Why trust:* Non-profit, detailed methodology, 20+ years Haiti experience
  - *Limitations:* Interview bias, access limited to safe areas

- **Academic Peer-Reviewed Papers:**
  - Example: Medellín violence reduction studies (MDPI, Cambridge, etc.)
  - *Why trust:* Peer review, replication, academic standards
  - *Limitations:* Lag time (published 2-5 years after events), access limited

- **World Bank / IMF Data:**
  - Economic indicators, GDP, poverty rates
  - *Why trust:* Standardized methodology, international comparison
  - *Limitations:* Haiti data collection weak, large margins of error

**Confidence Level:** **80-95%** for quantitative claims, **70-85%** for causal claims

---

### Tier 2: High Trust (Corroborate Before Major Decisions)
**Characteristics:** Reputable organizations, transparent sources, some verification, established track record

**Sources:**
- **Think Tanks:**
  - Brookings Institution
  - Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)
  - Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA)
  - Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC)
  - *Why trust:* Expert staff, field research, peer review (informal)
  - *Limitations:* May have policy agendas, funding influences focus

- **Investigative Journalism (Major Outlets):**
  - New York Times, Washington Post, Al Jazeera, Associated Press
  - *Why trust:* Editorial standards, fact-checking, multiple sources
  - *Limitations:* Sensationalism bias, access limited, time pressure

- **Local Haitian Research Organizations:**
  - RNDDH (Réseau National de Défense des Droits Humains)
  - *Why trust:* On-ground access, detailed incident reports, 30+ year track record
  - *Limitations:* Resource constraints, safety risks limit access, political targeting

- **NGO Reports:**
  - Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, ICTJ
  - *Why trust:* Specialized expertise, field investigators
  - *Limitations:* Advocacy focus may bias framing, selective reporting

**Confidence Level:** **70-85%** for facts, **60-75%** for interpretations

---

### Tier 3: Moderate Trust (Verify with Higher Tier Sources)
**Characteristics:** Local reporting, single-source claims, partial transparency

**Sources:**
- **Local Haitian Media:**
  - Haiti Times, Haiti Libre, Le Nouvelliste
  - *Why useful:* Rapid reporting, local context, on-ground witnesses
  - *Limitations:* Resource constraints, safety risks, less fact-checking, political pressures
  - *How to use:* Excellent for breaking news, situational awareness. Verify with Tier 1/2 for analysis.

- **Government Statements:**
  - Haitian Transitional Council, Police spokespersons, Economy Minister
  - *Why useful:* Official position, policy insights
  - *Limitations:* Propaganda, minimize failures, exaggerate successes
  - *How to use:* Reveals government thinking, but verify claims independently

- **International Government Reports:**
  - US State Department, EU reports
  - *Why useful:* Resources, intelligence access
  - *Limitations:* Political agendas, may soft-pedal ally failures

**Confidence Level:** **50-70%** for facts, **40-60%** for causal claims

---

### Tier 4: Low Trust (Treat as Hypotheses, Corroborate Heavily)
**Characteristics:** Single sources, anonymous claims, unverified, potential conflicts of interest

**Sources:**
- **Gang Leader Social Media:**
  - Jimmy "Barbecue" Cherizier's videos, gang propaganda
  - *Why useful:* Reveals gang narratives, recruitment messages, self-perception
  - *Limitations:* Pure propaganda, lies, psychological warfare
  - *How to use:* Study framing, not facts. Assume all claims are strategic.

- **Anonymous Sources:**
  - "A police officer said...", "A resident claimed..."
  - *Why useful:* May reveal truths insiders fear to state publicly
  - *Limitations:* Cannot verify, may have axes to grind
  - *How to use:* Generate hypotheses, then verify with named sources

- **Social Media / Rumor:**
  - Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp chains
  - *Why useful:* Rapid situational awareness, public sentiment
  - *Limitations:* Misinformation, manipulation, panic amplification
  - *How to use:* Monitor for trends, never cite as fact without verification

- **Politically Motivated Reports:**
  - Haitian diaspora advocacy groups, partisan think tanks
  - *Why useful:* Passion, insider knowledge, alternative perspectives
  - *Limitations:* Selective evidence, motivated reasoning
  - *How to use:* Compare multiple partisan sources, extract verified facts

**Confidence Level:** **20-50%** for facts, **10-30%** for causal claims

## Evidence Standards by Claim Type

### Quantitative Claims (Numbers, Statistics)

**Standard:** Require **two independent sources** from Tier 1-2, OR one Tier 1 + methodology review

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Strong Evidence:** "$60-75M annual gang revenue from extortion" 
  - Source: ICG report (Tier 1), based on Haitian Finance Minister statement + interviews + cargo tracking
  - Confidence: 75% (range is honest uncertainty, multiple methods converge)

- ⚠️ **Moderate Evidence:** "84,000 detained in El Salvador state of exception"
  - Source: Government statement (Tier 3), corroborated by Congressional Research Service (Tier 2)
  - Confidence: 85% (government incentive to inflate, but CRS verified)

- ❌ **Weak Evidence:** "50% of El Salvador detainees are innocent"
  - Source: Human rights lawyers estimate (Tier 3), based on extrapolation from cases reviewed
  - Confidence: 50% (reasonable methodology, but limited sample, government disputes)
  - *How to improve:* Need independent case reviews, judicial records

### Causal Claims (X caused Y)

**Standard:** Require **mechanism explanation** + **alternative hypotheses ruled out** + evidence from comparable cases

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Strong Evidence:** "Medellín's homicide reduction caused by social urbanism + security operations"
  - Mechanism: Physical integration reduced territorial gang control, economic alternatives reduced recruitment
  - Alternatives considered: Escobar's death, paramilitary demobilization (both factors, not sole cause)
  - Comparable cases: Comuna 13 (same model, similar results), Rio favelas (partial implementation, partial results)
  - Confidence: 80% (multiple factors, but social urbanism critical)

- ⚠️ **Moderate Evidence:** "El Salvador homicide drop caused by mass incarceration"
  - Mechanism: Gang leaders isolated, command structure disrupted
  - Alternatives not fully ruled out: Gang pacts to hide violence? Bukele negotiating with gangs? Both rumored but unproven
  - Comparable cases: None (El Salvador is unprecedented)
  - Confidence: 60% (correlation clear, but causation uncertain, alternative explanations exist)

- ❌ **Weak Evidence:** "International intervention caused Haiti's gang crisis"
  - Mechanism: Aid distortions, elite capture, US policy failures (all plausible, but non-specific)
  - Alternatives not ruled out: Haitian elite behavior, historical poverty, natural disasters (all also factors)
  - Comparable cases: Mixed (other countries with interventions didn't all collapse)
  - Confidence: 30% (likely a factor, but not THE cause, oversimplifies)

### Historical Claims (What happened in the past)

**Standard:** Require **primary sources** OR **multiple secondary sources** from different perspectives

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Strong Evidence:** "MINUSTAH peacekeepers caused 2010 cholera outbreak"
  - Primary source: Epidemiological study tracing cholera strain to Nepalese troops
  - Secondary: UN independent investigation confirmed (after initial denial)
  - Confidence: 95% (scientific consensus, UN admitted liability)

- ⚠️ **Moderate Evidence:** "Haitian elites historically funded gangs"
  - Sources: Multiple journalistic investigations, some named sources (e.g., Arrest warrants for Senators Cassy, Antoine)
  - But: Specific mechanisms, amounts, timelines unclear
  - Confidence: 75% (pattern well-documented, but details murky)

### Predictive Claims (What will happen)

**Standard:** Require **historical precedent** + **clear conditions** + **probability range** (never claim certainty)

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Good Prediction:** "If security not established, Medellín-style social urbanism will fail in Haiti"
  - Precedent: Development projects in Yemen, Afghanistan, Somalia failed under violence
  - Mechanism: Can't build infrastructure if workers are shot, gangs extort projects
  - Conditions: Medellín had baseline security before major urbanism projects
  - Confidence: 85% (strong precedent, clear mechanism)

- ⚠️ **Weak Prediction:** "El Salvador's mass incarceration will fail long-term"
  - Precedent: No exact comparable (El Salvador unprecedented)
  - Concerns: Prison overcrowding, no root cause address, democratic backsliding
  - But: Only 3 years old, too early to judge
  - Confidence: 40% (plausible, but insufficient data)

## Knowledge Gaps vs. Unknowable

### Knowable (With More Research)
- **Gang revenue breakdown by source** (kidnapping vs. extortion vs. drugs)
  - Method: Forensic accounting, gang member interviews, cargo tracking
  - Difficulty: High (gangs won't cooperate, cash-based economy)
  - Timeline: 1-2 years with resources

- **Elite-gang financial networks** (which businesses, which banks)
  - Method: Anti-money laundering investigations, asset tracing
  - Difficulty: High (offshore accounts, shell companies)
  - Timeline: 1-2 years with international cooperation

- **Historical periods of Haitian state success** (when, why, how)
  - Method: Archival research, oral histories, World Bank historical data
  - Difficulty: Medium (records exist but scattered)
  - Timeline: 6-12 months

### Unknowable (Fundamental Uncertainty)
- **Exact gang member count** (claimed 12,000-20,000)
  - Why unknowable: Fluid membership, no rosters, gangs lie
  - Best estimate: Range, updated regularly based on arrests, disarmament

- **Long-term El Salvador success** (will it work in 10+ years?)
  - Why unknowable: Future hasn't happened yet, many variables
  - Best approach: Monitor, compare to historical patterns, update predictions

- **Counterfactuals** ("What if MINUSTAH stayed longer?")
  - Why unknowable: Can't rerun history
  - Best approach: Compare to similar cases, reason about mechanisms, accept uncertainty

## How to Update Beliefs (Bayesian Approach)

### Start with Prior (Base Rate)
**Question:** Will DDR work in Haiti?  
**Prior:** DDR has ~60% success rate in post-conflict settings (based on Liberia, Sierra Leone, etc.)

### Update with Haiti-Specific Evidence
- **Evidence 1:** Gangs are winning, not defeated (unlike Liberia post-war)
  - Update: Success probability down to 30%
- **Evidence 2:** Haiti economy can't absorb 15k ex-gang members (no jobs)
  - Update: Success probability down to 20%
- **Evidence 3:** International force only 3,000 (vs. Liberia's 15,000)
  - Update: Success probability down to 10%

**Revised Estimate:** DDR in current Haiti has ~10% success chance (vs. 60% in typical post-conflict settings)

**Condition:** IF gangs defeated first, IF economy improved, IF international force increased  
**Then:** Success probability back up to 50-60%

## Competing Theories on Haiti Crisis Root Causes

### Theory 1: "Elite Capture" (Structural)
**Claim:** Haitian oligarchs deliberately maintain state failure to profit (monopolies, aid capture, smuggling)  
**Evidence For:**
- Arrest warrants for elite-gang collaboration (Senators Cassy, Antoine)
- Money laundering through elite-owned companies (UNODC)
- Historical pattern of elite resistance to reform
**Evidence Against:**
- Elites also suffer from instability (kidnapped, property destroyed)
- Some elites support reform efforts
**Verdict:** **Strong partial explanation** (elites are a key factor, but not sole cause)

### Theory 2: "International Intervention Failure" (External)
**Claim:** US/UN interventions caused crisis through aid distortions, elite empowerment, cholera, etc.  
**Evidence For:**
- MINUSTAH cholera killed 10,000
- Aid often captured by elites
- US support for dictators (Duvalier, etc.)
**Evidence Against:**
- Haiti had instability before major interventions (19th century)
- Other countries with similar interventions didn't collapse as badly
**Verdict:** **Moderate partial explanation** (interventions made things worse, but didn't create crisis from scratch)

### Theory 3: "Historical Poverty" (Economic)
**Claim:** Haiti is too poor to sustain functional state, gangs fill vacuum  
**Evidence For:**
- GDP per capita $1,700 (poorest in hemisphere)
- 60% below poverty line
- Gang recruitment driven by unemployment
**Evidence Against:**
- Other poor countries (Rwanda, $800 GDP/capita in 1994) recovered
- Haiti had periods of relative stability despite poverty
**Verdict:** **Strong partial explanation** (poverty is root cause, but not deterministic — can be overcome)

### Theory 4: "Cultural/Historical Trauma" (Social)
**Claim:** Slavery, colonialism, isolation created distrust of authority, weak institutions  
**Evidence For:**
- Haitian Revolution (1804) fought against oppression, deep distrust of centralized power
- Historical pattern of strongmen + rebellion cycles
- Weak civic institutions
**Evidence Against:**
- Other post-colonial states with similar trauma recovered (e.g., Rwanda)
- Haiti had functional periods (evidence gaps need filling)
**Verdict:** **Moderate partial explanation** (historical trauma shapes political culture, but not insurmountable)

### Theory 5: "Geographic Curse" (Environmental)
**Claim:** Hurricanes, earthquakes, deforestation make Haiti ungovernable  
**Evidence For:**
- 2010 earthquake killed 220,000
- Regular hurricanes devastate infrastructure
- 98% deforestation (soil erosion, agriculture collapse)
**Evidence Against:**
- Japan has earthquakes, hurricanes, still functions
- Cuba has hurricanes, more stable than Haiti
**Verdict:** **Weak explanation** (natural disasters are a challenge, not a cause of state failure)

### Synthesis (Best Explanation)
**Haiti's crisis is overdetermined** (multiple sufficient causes):
1. **Structural poverty** (economic desperation creates gang recruitment pool)
2. **Elite capture** (oligarchs block reforms that would empower middle class)
3. **Weak institutions** (historical distrust + poor governance = no state capacity)
4. **External shocks** (interventions, earthquakes, hurricanes) disrupt any progress

**Implication:** Must address ALL factors simultaneously. Fixing one (e.g., security) won't work if others (e.g., elite capture, poverty) remain.

## How This Research Was Conducted

### Search Strategy
1. **Broad queries first:** "Haiti gang economics," "Medellín transformation," etc.
2. **Follow citations:** Best sources cite other good sources
3. **Cross-validate:** Never cite single source for key claims
4. **Seek primary sources:** UN reports over news summaries

### Rate Limiting Adaptations
- Hit Brave Search API limit (1 query/sec)
- Shifted to `web_fetch` for full documents
- Prioritized highest-value sources (ICG, UNODC, academic papers)

### Time Allocation (1 hour budget)
- Gang economics research: 15 min ✅
- Comparative cases: 20 min ✅
- Solutions matrix: 20 min ✅
- Epistemic foundations: 10 min ✅
- Historical successes: ⏰ (out of time, flagged as next priority)

### What I Couldn't Access
- Some academic papers behind paywalls (MDPI, WOLA)
- Worked around by using search snippets + open-access versions
- Would benefit from university library access for deeper dives

## Confidence Levels Summary

**High Confidence (80-95%):**
- Gang revenue $60-75M/year from extortion
- Medellín achieved 90% homicide reduction over 25 years
- El Salvador homicide drop >80% since 2022
- Liberia DDR disarmed 100,000+ combatants

**Moderate Confidence (60-80%):**
- Elite-gang financial networks exist (know pattern, not specifics)
- El Salvador mass incarceration ~50% wrongful detentions
- Haitian gangs 70% children (UN estimate, methodology unclear)
- International intervention would need 15-20k troops to succeed

**Low Confidence (40-60%):**
- Exact gang member count (12-20k range)
- Diaspora remittances as leverage mechanism (untested)
- Long-term El Salvador success (too early to judge)

**Speculative (<40%):**
- What worked in historical Haiti (need more research)
- Optimal sequencing of interventions (theory, not tested in Haiti)
- Cost-benefit of each intervention (rough estimates, not rigorous)

## Next Steps to Improve Knowledge

1. **Historical Haiti research:** When did state function? Why? (Gap #2)
2. **Elite network mapping:** Names, companies, banks (Gap #4)
3. **Gang member interviews:** Motivations, economics, exit barriers (ethical challenges)
4. **Cost-benefit modeling:** Quantitative ROI for each intervention (econometric analysis)
5. **Scenario planning:** Best/worst/likely cases for each strategy (probabilistic)

---

## Meta-Note: Epistemic Humility

**I know more about Haiti now than I did 1 hour ago.**  
**I also know how much I still don't know.**

Key unknowns:
- Historical Haitian state capacity (Gap #2 - HIGH PRIORITY)
- Precise elite-gang networks (Gap #4)
- What motivates gang members (beyond money)
- Haitian public opinion (polling data scarce)
- Regional dynamics (DR, Jamaica, Cuba roles)

**This document will be updated as new evidence emerges.**  
**All probability estimates are subject to revision.**  
**Certainty is the enemy of truth. We work with best available evidence, while acknowledging gaps.**

**Research Principle:** "It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong." — Keynes

We have **rough accuracy** on the big questions:
- Gangs make millions from extortion ✅
- Mass incarceration has human rights costs ✅
- Social urbanism works IF security exists first ✅
- 20-year commitment required ✅

We lack **precision** on specifics:
- Exact gang revenue breakdown by source ⏰
- Optimal troop levels (15k? 20k?) ⏰
- Cost-benefit of DDR vs. other approaches ⏰

**Next research cycles will narrow the ranges and fill the gaps.**
