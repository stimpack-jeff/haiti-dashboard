---

## 1. Gang Economics & Funding Sources ✅ PARTIALLY FILLED

### What We Now Know:
**Revenue Streams (Total: $60-75M annually - ICG 2025)**
- **Container extortion from Dominican Republic:** $2,000/container × ~3,000 containers/month = ~$72M/year
- **Road tolls:** $1,500/truck/month + $190/trip from regional ports
- **Pedestrian tolls:** Variable fees in gang-controlled areas (even schoolchildren pay)
- **Kidnapping ransoms:** 1,494 kidnappings in 2024 (revenue not quantified)
- **Drug trafficking:** Claimed by gangs but "no judicially established evidence directly linking gangs to cocaine trafficking" (UNODC)
- **Arms trafficking:** Revenue from sales (not quantified)
- **Extortion of businesses/farmers:** Systematic in Port-au-Prince, Artibonite, Central Plateau

**Financial Infrastructure:**
- Money laundering methods: Bulk cash smuggling, unregulated money transfer services, front companies
- "Smurfing" (breaking large sums into small transactions)
- False invoicing, construction materials, real estate purchases
- Links to "politically-connected economic elites"

**Operational Details:**
- Gangs now "autonomous" from political/economic patrons (evolved since 2023)
- Control 80-90% of Port-au-Prince
- Control all access routes to capital (maritime, roads, DR border)
- Viv Ansanm coalition formed Feb 2024 - unprecedented merger of rival gangs

### Remaining Gaps:
1. **Kidnapping revenue quantification:** How much do ransoms actually generate annually? Average ransom amount?
2. **Drug trafficking volume:** If gangs claim substantial income from cocaine, what's the actual volume and value?
3. **Arms procurement costs:** What do gangs spend on weapons? Where's the price breakdown?
4. **Elite financial networks:** WHICH elites? Which companies? Specific names and mechanisms?
5. **Gang member salaries:** How much do foot soldiers get paid vs. leaders?
6. **Cryptocurrency usage:** Any evidence of crypto in money laundering?
7. **Bank account infrastructure:** Do gangs use formal banking? Which banks?
8. **International financial flows:** Beyond DR border, what external countries fund gangs?

**Impact if Filled:** Precise financial targeting for sanctions, asset seizures, and disruption strategies.

---

## 2. State Capacity Baselines & Historical Success Periods

### Gap Description:
When did Haiti have functional state capacity? What did that look like concretely? What specific governance mechanisms worked? Why did they stop working?

### Why Critical:
- Need realistic reconstruction targets (not fantasy benchmarks)
- Proof of concept that Haiti CAN function
- Understand what changed between success and failure
- Identify replicable governance models

### Key Questions:
1. **When were Haiti's "golden periods"?** (specific years/administrations)
2. **What was the police-to-population ratio when security worked?**
3. **Tax collection rates at historical peaks?**
4. **Judicial system conviction rates when functional?**
5. **What % of population had state services (health, education, roads) at peak?**
6. **Which international partnerships worked? Why?**
7. **What specific reforms enabled brief periods of improvement?**
8. **Why did improvements always collapse? Pattern analysis?**

### Research Approach:
- Academic historical analysis of Haitian governance
- World Bank/IMF historical data on state capacity indicators
- Oral histories from periods of stability
- Comparative timelines: governance quality vs. external interventions

**Status:** QUEUED

## 3. Comparative Gang Dismantling Success Cases

### Gap Description:
What SPECIFICALLY worked in other countries that had similar gang crises? What failed? Why?

### Why Critical:
Evidence-based intervention design. Avoid ideological solutions with no proof of efficacy.

### Key Comparison Cases:
1. **El Salvador (Bukele approach):** Mass incarceration, state of emergency
   - What worked? What are costs/risks?
   - Human rights trade-offs?
   - Long-term sustainability?

2. **Colombia (Medellín transformation):**
   - How did they break Escobar + paramilitary gangs?
   - Role of social urbanism?
   - Timeline from crisis to stability?

3. **Jamaica (Kingston gangs):**
   - What reduced garrison communities' power?
   - Role of political parties in gang funding (similar to Haiti elites?)

4. **Liberia (DDR post-civil war):**
   - How did they demobilize armed groups?
   - What incentives worked for disarmament?
   - Reintegration success rates?

5. **Rwanda (post-genocide security sector reform):**
   - How did they rebuild police/military from scratch?
   - Community-based security mechanisms?

### Key Questions Per Case:
- **Timeline:** How long did transformation take?
- **Cost:** Total investment required?
- **International support:** What role? What type?
- **Prerequisites:** What had to be in place first?
- **Failure points:** What didn't work?
- **Replicability:** What's transferable to Haiti?

**Status:** QUEUED (HIGH PRIORITY)

## 4. Elite Capture Mechanisms ✅ SUBSTANTIALLY FILLED (Feb 15, 2026)

### Gap Description:
HOW do Haitian elites maintain power? What are the precise economic and political structures? Who are they? What are their incentives?

### Why Critical:
Any solution that ignores elite incentives will be sabotaged from within.

### What We NOW Know (Research Cycle 1 - Feb 15, 2026):

**Key Elite Families Identified:**
1. **Gilbert Bigio & GB Group** (Haiti's only billionaire, $1-2B net worth)
   - Industries: Energy (petroleum), construction (steel, cement), consumer goods
   - Regional operations: Dominican Republic, Caribbean
   - Sanctioned by Canada, formed Macaya Group to evade
   - Jonathan Powell (Tony Blair's ex-chief of staff) worked as mediator, traveled with Bigio family official

2. **Mevs Family & WIN Group** (Infrastructure kings)
   - **Varreux Terminal:** Controls 70-80% of Haiti's fuel imports (SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE)
   - Industrial parks for foreign manufacturing (textile sector)
   - Private port operations, logistics

3. **Boulos Family** (Retail, healthcare, automotive)
   - Reginald Boulos: Medical doctor, businessman
   - Delimart supermarket chain, pharmaceutical supply, car dealerships
   - More politically visible than other elites
   - **Unverified claim:** "Barbecue offered money by Boulos" (Boomplay podcast - needs verification)

4. **Other Elite Families:**
   - Abdallah, Craan, Saïeh families (import-export, distribution)
   - Many Middle Eastern ancestry (Lebanese, Syrian diaspora from 1900s-1940s)

**How Elites Profit from State Failure:**
1. **Monopoly protection** (no antitrust = oligopolies unchallenged)
2. **Tax evasion** (Haiti collects 10-15% GDP in taxes vs. 25-35% in functional states)
3. **Aid capture** (contracts for supplies, logistics, construction from international donors)
4. **Import control** (Haiti produces nothing, elites own entire supply chains)
5. **Cheap labor** (gang violence = desperate workers at $2-5/day)
6. **Real estate speculation** (buy distressed assets from displaced people)
7. **Smuggling** (porous DR border = untaxed trade, billions in value)

**Money Laundering Mechanisms (UNODC Jan 2026):**
- **Front companies:** Gang cash laundered through elite construction, import-export firms
- **Bulk cash smuggling:** Physical transport across DR border, deposited in DR banks
- **"Smurfing":** Breaking large sums into small deposits (<$10K)
- **Real estate purchases:** Cash for property, sell later for "clean" money
- **False invoicing:** Over/under-invoice imports/exports to move money

**Elite Vulnerabilities:**
1. **International sanctions** (asset freezes in US, Canada, Europe, DR)
2. **RICO prosecutions** (US law allows charges for laundering gang proceeds)
3. **Reputational damage** (investigative journalism exposing ties)
4. **Dominican Republic cooperation** (DR could seal border, freeze assets)

### Remaining Gaps:
1. **What % of GDP do elites control?** (Estimated 60-80%, but no hard data)
2. **Specific companies involved in money laundering** (UNODC doesn't name them)
3. **Which banks?** (Haitian banks? DR banks? Offshore?)
4. **Historical elite reform sabotage patterns** (need archival research on 1990s-2000s)
5. **International elite assets** (where exactly? Panama Papers-style investigation needed)

### Research Completed:
- ✅ Elite families identified with names, industries, strategic chokepoints
- ✅ Money laundering mechanisms documented (UNODC + ICG sources)
- ✅ Elite incentives for state failure mapped
- ✅ Intervention leverage points identified (sanctions, RICO, exposure)

**Status:** **SUBSTANTIALLY FILLED** (90% complete - see `elite-gang-political-capture.md` for full analysis)

## 5. Diaspora Economic Leverage

### Gap Description:
What is the diaspora's actual economic power? How much leverage could they exert?

### Why Critical:
Diaspora could be a key pressure point if properly mobilized—but need to quantify their power.

### Key Questions:
1. **Total remittance flows per year?** (Latest data)
2. **What % of Haiti GDP is remittances?**
3. **Remittance distribution:** Who receives? Where? Through what channels?
4. **Diaspora asset ownership in Haiti?** (Real estate, businesses)
5. **Diaspora voting power:** If they could vote, would it matter?
6. **Diaspora organization level:** Who speaks for them? Unity?
7. **Historical diaspora influence:** When have they successfully pressured government?
8. **Remittance boycott feasibility:** Could diaspora credibly threaten to stop sending money?

### Potential Leverage Mechanisms:
- Conditional remittances (only to verified non-gang areas?)
- Boycott of specific businesses linked to elites/gangs
- Coordinated political pressure on host countries (US, Canada, France)
- Investment strikes (refuse to invest until conditions met)
- Information warfare (diaspora exposes elite corruption)

**Status:** QUEUED

---

## 6. Security Force Composition, Capability & Loyalty

### Gap Description:
Who are the Haitian police and military actually loyal to? What's their real capability vs. paper strength?

### Why Critical:
Can't build security on a foundation you don't understand. Need to know if current forces are salvageable or must start from scratch.

### Key Questions:
1. **Haitian National Police (HNP) current strength:** Actual vs. nominal numbers
2. **Gang infiltration of police:** What % are compromised? Which units?
3. **Police equipment/training quality:** vs. gang firepower
4. **Loyalty patterns:** To commanders? Politicians? Gangs? Paycheck?
5. **Desertion rates:** How many police have fled/quit?
6. **Police families targeted:** Impact on morale (400 Mawozo targeted police families)
7. **Military capability:** If mobilized, could they defeat gangs?
8. **Vetted units:** Are there any units considered trustworthy?
9. **Pay rates:** Police vs. gang member salaries (competing incentives?)
10. **International force (MSS/GSF) effectiveness:** What have they actually achieved? Constraints?

### Research Approach:
- UNODC security reports
- UN mission (BINUH) assessments
- Leaked police internal documents
- Interviews with security experts
- Comparative salary/incentive analysis

**Status:** QUEUED

---

## 7. International Intervention Failure Analysis

### Gap Description:
Why have MINUSTAH, previous UN missions, and US interventions failed? What are the specific mechanisms of failure?

### Why Critical:
If we don't understand why past interventions failed, we'll repeat the same mistakes with different labels.

### Historical Interventions to Analyze:
1. **MINUSTAH (2004-2017):** 13 years, $7+ billion, why did gangs return?
2. **US intervention (1994-1995):** Restored Aristide, but then what?
3. **US occupation (1915-1934):** 19 years, what was built? Why did it collapse?
4. **Current MSS mission (Kenya-led):** What's working? What isn't?
5. **Upcoming GSF (UN-backed):** Why will it be different?

### Key Questions Per Intervention:
- **Stated goals vs. actual outcomes:** Gap analysis
- **Duration:** Was it long enough? Too long?
- **Troop strength:** Adequate? Rules of engagement?
- **Coordination with Haitian authorities:** Functional?
- **Corruption within intervention forces:** How much?
- **Exit strategy:** Did one exist? Was it realistic?
- **Local buy-in:** Did Haitians support it? Why/why not?
- **Unintended consequences:** Sexual exploitation by peacekeepers, cholera outbreak (MINUSTAH), etc.

### Failure Pattern Analysis:
- Do interventions inadvertently strengthen gangs? (Aid capture, black markets)
- Does foreign presence delegitimize local government?
- Are timelines always too short for actual state-building?
- Does lack of accountability for intervening forces create resentment?

**Status:** QUEUED

## 8. Resource Curse Economics & True Economic Potential

### Gap Description:
Does Haiti have untapped natural resources? What is the country's real economic potential?

### Why Critical:
Determines if self-sustaining recovery is possible or if Haiti faces perpetual aid dependency.

### Key Questions:
1. **Natural resource inventory:** Gold, copper, other minerals?
2. **Resource extraction feasibility:** Cost vs. value? Infrastructure needs?
3. **Oil/gas potential:** Any offshore reserves?
4. **Agricultural potential:** What could Haiti export at scale?
5. **Tourism potential:** If stable, what's realistic tourism revenue?
6. **Manufacturing potential:** What competitive advantages exist? (Low labor costs? Proximity to US?)
7. **Service sector potential:** Call centers, tech outsourcing?
8. **Diaspora investment potential:** If stable, how much would flow in?
9. **Historical GDP peaks:** When was Haiti most prosperous? What drove it?
10. **Comparative economic analysis:** Why is Dominican Republic more successful?

### Economic Models to Test:
- **Resource extraction-led growth:** Risks of corruption, elite capture
- **Export-oriented manufacturing:** Requires security + infrastructure
- **Tourism-led recovery:** Requires stability + marketing
- **Remittance-dependent model:** Status quo, sustainable?
- **Agricultural revival:** Food security + exports

**Status:** QUEUED

## 9. Dominican Republic & Regional Dynamics

### Gap Description:
What role does the DR play in Haiti's crisis? How do border economics work? What's the regional stability impact?

### Why Critical:
Can't solve Haiti in isolation. DR is the main trade partner, border is main smuggling route, and regional stability affects both countries.

### Key Questions:
1. **DR-Haiti trade volume:** Legal + illegal flows?
2. **Border control effectiveness:** How porous? Where?
3. **DR government interests:** Do they benefit from weak Haiti? Or threatened by it?
4. **DR gang presence:** Do Haitian gangs operate in DR?
5. **Haitian workers in DR:** How many? Remittances? Treatment?
6. **DR security cooperation:** Is it genuine? What's been tried?
7. **Arms/drug trafficking routes:** Specific border crossing points?
8. **Dominican public opinion on Haiti:** Support for intervention? Hostility?
9. **Regional organizations:** CARICOM, OAS - what influence do they have?
10. **Jamaica, Bahamas, Cuba roles:** Any significant involvement?

### Border Economy Details:
- Container extortion route: How exactly does cargo move? Who controls what?
- Informal cross-border trade: What goods? Who profits?
- Migration patterns: Why do Haitians flee to DR vs. US/Canada?
- Border violence: How often do gangs clash near border?

**Status:** QUEUED

## 10. Implementation Challenges for Proposed Solutions

### Gap Description:
For each proposed intervention, what are the SPECIFIC implementation challenges and prerequisites?

### Why Critical:
Solutions look good on paper but fail in execution. Need granular understanding of implementation barriers.

### Example Interventions to Analyze:
1. **Mass incarceration (El Salvador model):**
   - Prerequisite: Functional prisons (Haiti has how many cells? Gang control of prisons?)
   - Challenge: Judicial capacity to process cases
   - Risk: Creating martyrs, recruiting in prison

2. **DDR (Disarmament, Demobilization, Reintegration):**
   - Prerequisite: Credible security guarantees for disarming gang members
   - Challenge: Alternative livelihoods for ex-combatants (what jobs exist?)
   - Risk: Gang leaders hide weapons, fake demobilization

3. **Economic development approach:**
   - Prerequisite: Security sufficient for investment
   - Challenge: Corruption/elite capture of development funds
   - Risk: Aid fuels corruption, strengthens gangs via extortion

4. **International military intervention:**
   - Prerequisite: Haitian government buy-in (current transitional council stable?)
   - Challenge: Avoiding civilian casualties in dense urban warfare
   - Risk: Creating resentment, gangs wait out intervention

### For Each Solution:
- **Timeline:** Minimum time to see results?
- **Cost:** Realistic budget?
- **Personnel:** Who implements? Capacity exists?
- **Sequencing:** What must happen first? What can happen in parallel?
- **Failure modes:** How could this go wrong?
- **Success indicators:** How would we know it's working?

**Status:** QUEUED

## 11. Gang Political Alliances & Intermediaries ✅ PARTIALLY FILLED (Feb 15, 2026)

**What We NOW Know:**

**Guy Philippe - Primary Gang Political Ally:**
- **Background:** Former HNP officer, 2004 coup leader, convicted drug trafficker
- **Criminal Record:** Served 6 years in US federal prison (conspiracy to launder $1.5M+ drug proceeds)
- **Deported to Haiti:** November 2023 (immediately resumed political activity)
- **2016:** Elected to Haitian Senate (despite drug accusations = shows real constituency)
- **Arrested by DEA:** January 2017 (day after being sworn in as Senator)

**Philippe's Gang Amnesty Advocacy:**
- **March 2024:** Publicly called for PM Ariel Henry to resign
- **Nationalist rhetoric:** Anti-US, anti-international intervention
- **ICG Assessment (Dec 2025):** "The politician most openly aligned with gangs' demands"
- **Openly advocates:** "Wide-ranging amnesty" for gang members AND economic elites
- **Framing:** "Haitians must forgive one another" (echoes Barbecue's language)

**Philippe's Political Power:**
- **March 2024:** Party declined CPT seat, backed "alternate council that would empower Philippe"
- **Popular support:** Nationalist following (anti-elite, anti-US rhetoric appeals to poor)
- **2016 Senate win:** Demonstrates real constituency despite criminal record
- **Social media active:** Rallies, speeches livestreamed

**Philippe-Gang Connection Evidence:**
- ❌ **NO DIRECT PROOF** of meetings with/funding for Viv Ansanm leaders
- ✅ **BUT:** Political platform PERFECTLY aligns with gang demands (amnesty, anti-intervention)
- ✅ ICG: Philippe "tied to political figures sympathetic to gang demands"
- ✅ Soufan Center: Philippe "offered amnesty to gang leaders should he attain office"
- ✅ **Circumstantial but strong:** Former 2004 rebels (Philippe's comrades) likely became gang leaders

**Intermediaries (Suspected but Unproven):**
1. **Former 2004 rebels:** Philippe's armed group → some became gang leaders
2. **Political operatives:** Campaign staff who move between legal politics and gang territories
3. **Lawyers:** Gang leaders need legal representation, could communicate Philippe proposals
4. **Business intermediaries:** Elites funding BOTH Philippe AND gangs
5. **Prison networks:** Philippe + deported gang members passed through same US prisons

**Other CPT/Political Connections:**
- **5 CPT members sanctioned by US** (January 2026 - visa restrictions for attempting to oust Fils-Aimé)
  - Names not fully public in sources consulted
  - Need research: Are ANY of the 5 connected to gangs?
- **Former Senator Nenel Cassy:** Arrest warrant for gang support (attacking Kenscoff)
- **Former legislator Alfredo Antoine:** Arrest warrant for gang support

### Remaining Gaps:
1. **WHO are Philippe's specific intermediaries?** (Names, roles, methods)
2. **Has Philippe met with Viv Ansanm leaders?** (Direct contact? Through proxies?)
3. **Who funds Philippe's political activities?** (Elites? Diaspora? Gangs?)
4. **5 sanctioned CPT members:** Names, backgrounds, gang connections?
5. **Are ANY current Fils-Aimé cabinet members gang-linked?**
6. **Future election candidates:** Are gangs backing specific individuals?

**Status:** **PARTIALLY FILLED** (70% complete - see `elite-gang-political-capture.md` for full analysis)

## 12. Fils-Aimé Government Capacity & Legitimacy ✅ PARTIALLY FILLED (Feb 15, 2026)

**What We NOW Know:**

**How Fils-Aimé Became PM (Undemocratic Process):**
- **April 2024:** CPT formed after Ariel Henry resignation
- **May 2024:** CPT appointed Garry Conille as PM
- **November 11, 2024:** CPT ousted Conille after only 5.5 months
- **November 12, 2024:** CPT appointed Fils-Aimé as PM (second PM in 6 months)
- **January 2026:** CPT attempted to oust Fils-Aimé - **US blocked with sanctions on 5 CPT members**
- **February 5, 2026:** **3 US warships deployed** to Port-au-Prince Bay (show of force)
- **February 7, 2026:** CPT mandate expired - **Fils-Aimé now sole executive authority**

**Democratic Legitimacy: ZERO**
- No elections since 2016 (10 years)
- Fils-Aimé appointed by unelected CPT
- CPT appointed by opaque process (US-backed "Montana Accord" groups)
- Last elected president (Jovenel Moïse) assassinated July 2021
- **Result:** Haiti has NO elected government at ANY level (president, legislators, local officials)

**US Control:**
- Secretary of State Marco Rubio: Explicitly ordered CPT dissolution by Feb 7
- US Embassy (Feb 5): "We support Prime Minister Fils-Aimé's leadership"
- **Translation:** Fils-Aimé is US puppet, zero independent power base

**Cabinet Composition:**
- **18 ministers** (announced Nov 16, 2024)
- **8 retained from Conille government** (some continuity)
- 10 new appointments
- **Minister names/backgrounds:** NOT YET RESEARCHED (critical gap)

**Governance Capacity Assessment:**

**Elections:**
- **Provisional Electoral Council declared elections "IMPOSSIBLE"** (Nov 2025, before Feb 7)
- No progress on election preparation under Fils-Aimé
- Gangs control 90% of Port-au-Prince = voting logistics impossible

**Service Delivery:**
- Most Port-au-Prince hospitals closed/inaccessible (gang control)
- Schools largely non-functional in capital
- **NO EVIDENCE** of Fils-Aimé government improving service delivery (Nov 2024 - Feb 2026)

**Security Coordination:**
- **Kenyan MSS/GSF:** Unclear if Fils-Aimé actually coordinates or they operate independently
- **HNP Chief Rameau Normil** (appointed 2024): Trust relationship with Fils-Aimé unknown

**Budget Execution:**
- No public data on ministry spending vs. allocations
- Haiti chronically fails to spend budgeted funds (corruption, capacity limits)
- **Critical gap:** Need 2024-2025 budget execution reports

**Assessment:** Fils-Aimé can issue statements and hold meetings, but **CANNOT deliver services, CANNOT organize elections, CANNOT control territory.**

**Gang Negotiation Posture (Unknown):**
- **NO PUBLIC EVIDENCE** of Fils-Aimé negotiating with gangs
- **BUT:** ICG warns gangs "hoping new government will include politicians willing to negotiate"
- **Scenarios:**
  1. Stays hardline (US position) → gangs continue attacks
  2. Secretly explores amnesty → US withdraws support if discovered
  3. **Most likely:** Paralysis (waits for Kenyan force, does nothing)

### Remaining Gaps:
1. **Cabinet member names, backgrounds, capacity** (Interior, Finance, Justice ministers critical)
2. **Popular support:** Haitian public opinion on Fils-Aimé (polling data if exists?)
3. **Budget execution:** 2024-2025 ministry spending analysis
4. **HNP relationship:** Does Police Chief trust Fils-Aimé? Follow orders?
5. **Secret gang negotiations:** Is he or his proxies meeting with Viv Ansanm?
6. **US coordination:** How closely does he work with US Embassy? Autonomous decisions?

**Status:** **PARTIALLY FILLED** (60% complete - see `elite-gang-political-capture.md` for full analysis)

## 13. MSS/GSF Operational Effectiveness & Constraints (NEW - Feb 15, 2026)

### Gap Description:
What are Kenyan forces ACTUALLY doing? Why haven't they achieved more with 1,000 troops deployed since June 2024?

### Why Critical:
UN plans to scale MSS/GSF to 5,500 troops by summer 2026. If current force ineffective, scaling up won't help. Need to understand operational constraints to design better interventions.

### Key Questions:
1. **Rules of engagement:** Are Kenyan forces authorized to conduct offensive operations? Night raids? Arrest gang leaders?
2. **Operational tempo:** How many patrols/operations per day? Passive presence or active combat?
3. **Casualties:** Kenyan forces killed/wounded? Gang members killed? Civilian casualties from MSS operations?
4. **Territorial gains:** Have gangs lost ANY territory since MSS deployed? If so, where?
5. **Equipment/training:** Are Kenyan police equipped for urban warfare against heavy weapons (gangs have .50 cal, military-grade arms)?
6. **Coordination with HNP:** Do Haitian police trust Kenyans? Language barriers? Command structure?
7. **Funding constraints:** Why only 1,000 deployed vs. 5,500 authorized? Money? Kenyan domestic politics? UN bureaucracy?
8. **Mission creep risk:** If MSS forced to occupy territory (not just patrol), does Kenya have appetite for long-term deployment?

### What We Know (Partial):
- <1,000 troops deployed (mostly Kenyan police) as of Feb 2026
- UN aims for 5,500 by summer 2026 (18+ months behind schedule)
- "Fragile" security gains - roads reopened, Champ de Mars secured (UN Jan 2026)
- Murder rate UP 20% in 2025 vs. 2024 despite MSS presence
- Gangs intensified attacks on MSS infrastructure May 2024 (destroyed facilities earmarked for forces)
- Chronic underfunding cited as main constraint

### Research Approach:
- Kenyan press reports on MSS casualties, operational challenges
- UN internal assessments of MSS effectiveness (likely classified - need leaks or FOIA equivalent)
- Interviews with Haitian civilians in areas where MSS operates (quality of security?)
- Comparison to MINUSTAH operations (2004-2017) - same mistakes?
- Academic analysis of police vs. military peacekeeping effectiveness

**Status:** IDENTIFIED (Feb 15, 2026) - HIGH PRIORITY

## 14. Viv Ansanm Internal Dynamics & Fracture Points (NEW - Feb 15, 2026)

### Gap Description:
How does Viv Ansanm actually function? What could fracture the alliance?

### Why Critical:
**Divide and conquer** requires knowing where the cracks are. Targeted strikes on leaders could fracture alliance (or strengthen it - need intelligence). Negotiation strategy depends on understanding internal power dynamics.

### Key Questions:
1. **Revenue sharing:** How is $60-75M annual extortion revenue split among member gangs? Disputes?
2. **Leadership structure:** Is Jimmy "Barbecue" Chérizier actual leader or just spokesperson? Who makes strategic decisions?
3. **Gang hierarchy:** Which gangs are most powerful within Viv Ansanm? (G9 vs. G-Pèp balance?)
4. **Pragmatists vs. hardliners:** Which leaders open to negotiation vs. those who want perpetual conflict?
5. **Succession planning:** If Chérizier killed/arrested, who replaces him? Would alliance survive?
6. **Member dissatisfaction:** Are some gangs unhappy with alliance? Why?
7. **Rival factions:** Are there gangs NOT in Viv Ansanm? Could they be leveraged to fight Viv Ansanm?
8. **Rank-and-file sentiment:** Do gang foot soldiers support political strategy or prefer purely criminal operations?

### What We Know (Partial):
- Viv Ansanm formed Sep 2023, but became cohesive after Feb 29, 2024 coordinated attacks
- 78% reduction in gang-vs-gang fighting since Feb 2024 (ACLED)
- Alliance holds BECAUSE of shared threat from MSS/GSF (ACLED analysis)
- Jimmy Chérizier most visible leader (FBI fugitive, former elite police officer)
- Gang leaders livestream less than before, but remain active on social media
- Tensions and occasional fighting (e.g., August clash in Carrefour, September dispute over football game)

### Research Approach:
- Gang defector interviews (if any exist safely outside Haiti)
- Social media analysis of gang communications (threats, disputes, celebrations)
- Intelligence gathering on gang leadership meetings, revenue disputes
- Economic analysis: Profitability comparison across Viv Ansanm member gangs
- Historical pattern analysis: When have gang alliances fractured in past? Why?

**Status:** IDENTIFIED (Feb 15, 2026) - MEDIUM PRIORITY

---

## 15. Dominican Republic Cooperation & Interests (NEW - Feb 15, 2026)

### Gap Description:
Is DR truly committed to stopping Haiti gang operations? Or do they benefit from Haiti's weakness?

### Why Critical:
**DR controls Haiti's lifelines.** $72M/year in container extortion happens at DR-Haiti border. Arms trafficking flows through DR. Can't solve Haiti without DR cooperation (or at least non-interference).

### Key Questions:
1. **DR government position:** Does President Luis Abinader support strong Haiti intervention? Or prefer weak neighbor?
2. **DR business interests:** Do DR companies profit from Haiti instability? (Monopolize trade, cheap Haitian labor, gang extortion payments?)
3. **Border enforcement capacity:** Could DR militarily seal border if committed? What resources needed?
4. **Arms trafficking complicity:** Are DR officials/military complicit in arms flows to Haiti gangs?
5. **DR public opinion:** Xenophobia toward Haitian migrants? Support for intervention?
6. **Elite ties:** Are DR elites connected to Haitian gang money laundering networks?
7. **US leverage:** How much influence does US have over DR Haiti policy? Aid conditionality? Security cooperation?
8. **Military intervention possibility:** Under what conditions would DR deploy troops into Haiti? (Historical precedent: 1937 Parsley Massacre, 1965 occupation)

### What We Know (Partial):
- $2,000/container × ~3,000/month extortion happens at DR-Haiti border = $72M/year
- 400 Mawozo gang controls customs office and police stations at DR border (Ganthier)
- Gangs control National Road 2 connecting to DR
- DR has historically intervened in Haiti (not always positively)
- No recent reports of DR military action against gangs on border

### Research Approach:
- DR Ministry of Defense/Interior statements on Haiti border security
- Trade data analysis: DR-Haiti cross-border flows (legal + estimated illegal)
- DR political analysis: Would Abinader's coalition support intervention? Domestic political constraints?
- Investigative journalism on DR-Haiti criminal networks (follow the container extortion money)
- Historical research: DR intervention patterns, motivations, outcomes

## Research Methodology Notes

### Source Quality Hierarchy:
1. **Tier 1 (Highest Trust):**
   - Peer-reviewed academic papers
   - UN official reports (UNODC, BINUH, UN Human Rights)
   - International Crisis Group (ICG) reports
   - World Bank/IMF datasets

2. **Tier 2 (High Trust):**
   - Reputable think tanks (Brookings, CSIS, Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime)
   - Investigative journalism from established outlets (NYT, WaPo, Al Jazeera)
   - Local Haitian research organizations (RNDDH - Réseau National de Défense des Droits Humains)

3. **Tier 3 (Verify):**
   - Local Haitian media (Haiti Times, Haiti Libre)
   - NGO reports (with known biases/agendas)
   - Social media claims from gang leaders (propaganda, but reveals their framing)

4. **Tier 4 (Corroborate Heavily):**
   - Anonymous sources
   - Single-source claims
   - Politically motivated reports

### Evidence Standards:
- **Quantitative claims:** Require at least two independent sources
- **Causation claims:** Require mechanism + evidence, not just correlation
- **Historical claims:** Require primary sources when possible
- **Competing theories:** Document all sides, assess evidence quality

## Next Steps

**Immediate Priority Queue:**
1. ✅ Gang Economics (PARTIALLY COMPLETE - gaps remain)
2. Comparative Gang Dismantling Cases (Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica, Liberia, Rwanda)
3. Elite Capture Mechanisms (who, how, why)
4. Historical State Capacity (when did Haiti work?)
5. Security Force Analysis (capability, loyalty, corruption)

**Research Time Allocation (1 hour total):**
- Gang Economics: 15 min ✅ DONE
- Comparative Cases: 20 min (deep dive on 2-3 best examples)
- Elite Capture: 10 min (names, networks, mechanisms)
- Historical Success: 10 min (identify peak periods, what worked)
- Synthesis + Matrix Creation: 15 min

**Output Goals:**
- `comparative-cases.md` with concrete evidence from successful interventions
- `solutions-matrix.md` with evidence ratings + feasibility + costs
- `historical-successes.md` with proof Haiti CAN function (when/why)
- `epistemic-foundations.md` on source quality + how we know what we know
